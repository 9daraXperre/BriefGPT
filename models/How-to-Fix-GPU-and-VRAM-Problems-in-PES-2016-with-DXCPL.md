DXCPL is a DirectX Control Panel that allows you to configure some DirectX settings and features. It can help you to enable or disable some DirectX features that may affect the performance of your games. For example, you can use DXCPL to force your game to run on DirectX 11 mode, even if your GPU does not support it.
 
To use DXCPL to fix GPU and VRAM problems in PES 2016, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download DXCPL from [here](https://ecalbenbiva.wixsite.com/trovminbelgtur/post/dxcpl-32-bit-pes-2016-crack) for 32-bit systems or [here](https://www.bechdepokhara.com/2020/03/dxcplexe-download-for-pes-2017-2019.html) for 64-bit systems.
2. Extract the DXCPL.exe file and run it as administrator.
3. Click on the "Edit List" button and add the PES 2016.exe file from your game folder.
4. Check the "Force WARP" option and set the "Feature level limit" to 11\_1.
5. Click on "Apply" and then "OK".
6. Run PES 2016 and enjoy the game without GPU and VRAM problems.

Note: This method may not work for all PCs and may cause some graphical glitches or crashes. Use it at your own risk and backup your game files before applying any changes.
  
DXCPL can also be used to fix other DirectX related problems in PES 2016, such as black screen, lag, or low FPS. You can try to tweak some other settings in DXCPL to optimize your game performance. For example, you can check the "Disable feature level upgrade" option to prevent your game from using higher DirectX features than your GPU can handle. You can also adjust the "Maximum memory budget" and "Maximum memory latency" sliders to control how much memory your game can use and how fast it can access it.
 
However, DXCPL is not a magic solution that can make your game run perfectly on any PC. It is only a workaround that may help some players with low-end or incompatible GPUs. The best way to enjoy PES 2016 without any problems is to have a PC that meets the minimum or recommended system requirements for the game.

PES 2016 is a great game that offers realistic graphics, gameplay, and physics. It also features many modes, teams, players, and stadiums to choose from. If you are a fan of soccer games, you should definitely give PES 2016 a try. And if you encounter any GPU or VRAM problems while playing it, you can use DXCPL to fix them and enjoy the game without any hassle.
  
Another way to fix GPU and VRAM problems in PES 2016 is to update your graphics card drivers. Drivers are software that allow your PC to communicate with your hardware devices. Updating your drivers can improve your PC performance and compatibility with new games and applications. You can update your drivers manually by visiting the website of your graphics card manufacturer and downloading the latest version for your model. Alternatively, you can use a driver updater tool that can automatically scan your PC and install the best drivers for your devices.
 
Some examples of driver updater tools are [Driver Booster](https://www.iobit.com/en/driver-booster.php), [Driver Easy](https://www.drivereasy.com/), and [AVG Driver Updater](https://www.avg.com/en-us/avg-driver-updater). These tools are easy to use and can save you time and hassle. However, you should be careful when using them and always backup your drivers before updating them. Some driver updater tools may install unwanted or outdated drivers that can cause more problems than they solve.
 
Updating your drivers can also help you to fix other common PC problems, such as blue screen of death, sound issues, or network errors. It can also enhance your PC security and stability. Therefore, it is recommended to update your drivers regularly and keep them up to date.
